I'm thinking of building a project that concerns human resources. The idea of the startup is a middleware API or a third party. Companies can create forms like Google Forms with attached files and then get a link to share with their users. The form can be related to a job, internship, or any program with a description and the company's expectations. What I will do is develop a machine learning that gets the information of the different candidates. In the company's dashboard, the company can choose to get an "n" number of best CVS that fit the position requirements, eligibility, and preferences and will get statistics and data like a Monte Carlo graph (and any possible graph that can serve later on) and analysis that concerns the data like most technologies mastered by the candidates, language skills, their ages so the company can have an idea about the users that submitted these forms. 1- What do you think of the idea? 2- What other services can I provide?  3- What is the potential? 4- Are there competitors? 5- What can be my competitive advantage?
